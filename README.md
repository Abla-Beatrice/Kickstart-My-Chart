# Statistical Analysis

* Used conditional formatting

* Created a new column

* Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzed my initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were ***successful***, ***failed***, ***canceled***, or are currently live per **category** and per **sub-category**.

* Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table I have created.

* The dates stored within the `deadline` and `launched_at` columns use Unix timestamps. 

### Report of the Analysis

As we can see, more than half of Kickstarter campaigns succeeded, the other failed or was cancelled. 

Music campaigns and Theater had the higher success rate than other campaign categories.

Only the United States had enough data.There was not enough data for most countries in Kickstart for having any conclusions. 

We could create some pivot tables and graphs to check the duration of campaigns by country and category.
