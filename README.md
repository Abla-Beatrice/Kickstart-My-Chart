## Statistical Analysis - Excel

* Used conditional formatting 

* Created a new columns

* Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzed my initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were ***successful***, ***failed***, ***canceled***, or are currently live per **category** and per **sub-category**.

* Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table I have created.

* Used Unix timestamps to store dates within the `deadline` and  `launched_at` columns. 

* Used the `COUNTIFS()` formula, to count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals.

* Created a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

### Report of the Analysis

* As we can see, more than half of Kickstarter campaigns succeeded, the other failed or was cancelled. 

* Music campaigns and Theater had the higher success rate than other campaign categories.

* Only the United States had enough data.
There was not enough data for most countries in Kickstart for having any conclusions. 

* We could create some pivot tables and graphs to check the duration of campaigns by country and category.
