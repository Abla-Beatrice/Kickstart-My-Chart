# Statistical Analysis

* Used conditional formatting
* Created a new column
* Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzed my initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were ***successful***, ***failed***, ***canceled***, or are currently live per **category** and per **sub-category**.

* Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table I have created.
